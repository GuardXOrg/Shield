# Shield
Smart contract for Shield tokens (SHLD)

Shield is the name of our utility token used to issue <a href="https://github.com/legize">Legize</a> certificates.

Here we will develop our smart contract that will:
- Verify. Legize checks the background of each project and verifies if it is safe or not. If a project meets our strict requirements then a certificate is issued.
- Check. Each Legize certificate issues a unique reference number that can be checked on our public database. This prevents fraudulent certificates.
- Invest. If a project has our Legize certificate then you can invest with full confidence knowing that youâ€™ll not be buying into a scam, pump and dump or weak team.

How does it work?
- Apply. In order to apply for a Legize certificate, developers must hold, at least, 500 SHLD. Then they must fill out the applicant form.
- Review. We check the applicants address and then confirm and verify that a project meets our validation points and requirements.
Issue. Once a project is verified by our team, we will issue a Legize certificate along with a publicly viewable reference and score.
- Maintain. We will do automatic checks to ensure quality consistentency. Applicants must always hold 500 SHLDs to keep their certificate active.
